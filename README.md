## I created a boiler plate, with this you can start working on a small to medium Single Page Application

```
npm install
npm start

In this example, you can go to Demo view and fill up the form, the informations will be store as state in the App.js 

Once you clicked submit, you will be send to home page.

The states are available in all the views.
